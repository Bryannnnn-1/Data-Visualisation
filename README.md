# Data Visualisation

A project designed to visualise problems and solutions discovered by a parcel delivery and distribution company.

## Overview

This repository contains data visualisation tools and scripts, built using Python, to help analyse and address operational challenges faced by parcel delivery and distribution businesses. The primary goal is to identify, illustrate, and solve common bottlenecks and inefficiencies using visual data insights.

## Features

- Visualisation of parcel flow and delivery processes
- Identification of operational issues such as delayed shipments, misroutes, and resource allocation
- Comparison of proposed solutions using interactive charts and graphs
- Easy-to-understand dashboards for stakeholders

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (100%)
- Popular Python data visualisation libraries such as:
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Plotly
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)

*Note: See `requirements.txt` or relevant documentation for full package list.*

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bryannnnn-1/Data-Visualisation.git
   cd Data-Visualisation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run example scripts or notebooks**
   - Check out the `examples/` or `notebooks/` folder.

     ```

4. **Input Your Own Data**
   - Place your data files in the appropriate input directory.
   - Adjust scripts as needed to point to your data sources.

## Example Visualisations

- Delivery time histograms
- Route optimisation plots
- Heatmaps of bottleneck zones
- Before/after solution comparisons
